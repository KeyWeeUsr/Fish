# Fish
![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/KeyWeeUsr/Fish/master/screen.png)

Fish is a simple eat&grow game situated in an ocean. You'll play as a young fish which can get big really fast, but beware of the bigger fish. They'll swallow you in the blink of an eye.

### Install

Fish is written in Python and runs under Kivy framework.
You can clone the repository to your /sdcard/kivy/ if you use Kivy Launcher on android or download only [APK](https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/Fish/tree/master/bin). For using the APK you need to enable installation from "Unknown sources".
If you use Windows, there is a [setup](https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/Fish/tree/master/bin) file.

### About
As a kid I played a similar game with all those colorful fish and pretty animations. Therefore I've made my own version to bring it back and share some code.
